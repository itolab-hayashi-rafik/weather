'''This example examines recurrent performance in a memory task.
In the memory task, a network is supposed to read in T frames of n-dimensional
data and reproduce the first t frames at the output of the network, after
reading in T - t additional frames of n-dimensional data.
This task is quite difficult for most neural network models, since the hidden
layer in the network must effectively store the first inputs somewhere, preserve
those values for an arbitrary amount of time (while also discarding any new
inputs), and then reproduce the stored inputs in the proper order.
This example uses a vanilla RNN to perform this task, but the network
configuration can easily be changed to test the performance of different
layer types (or even multilayer architectures).
