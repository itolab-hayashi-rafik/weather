Investigation of Recurrent Neural Network Architectures and Learning Methods for Spoken Language Understanding
==============================================================================================================

### Code for RNN and Spoken Language Understanding

Based on the Interspeech '13 paper:

[Grégoire Mesnil, Xiaodong He, Li Deng and Yoshua Bengio - **Investigation of Recurrent Neural Network Architectures and Learning Methods for Spoken Language Understanding**](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/RNNSpokenLanguage2013.pdf)

We also have a follow-up IEEE paper:

[Grégoire Mesnil, Yann Dauphin, Kaisheng Yao, Yoshua Bengio, Li Deng, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Xiaodong He, Larry Heck, Gokhan Tur, Dong Yu and Geoffrey Zweig - **Using Recurrent Neural Networks for Slot Filling in Spoken Language Understanding**](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/taslp_RNNSLU_final_doubleColumn.pdf)

## Code

This code allows to get state-of-the-art results and a significant improvement
(+1% in F1-score) with respect to the results presented in the paper.

In order to reproduce the results, make sure Theano is installed and run the following commands:

```
git clone git@github.com:mesnilgr/is13.git
python is13/examples/elman-forward.py
```

For running the Jordan architecture:

```
python is13/examples/jordan-forward.py
```

## ATIS Data

[Download ATIS Dataset here!](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3lxl9jsbw0j7h8a/atis.pkl?dl=0)

```
import cPickle
train, test, dicts = cPickle.load(open("atis.pkl"))
```

`dicts` is a python dictionnary that contains the mapping from the labels, the
name entities (if existing) and the words to indexes used in `train` and `test`
lists. Refer to this [tutorial](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/rnnslu.html) for more details. 

Running the following command can give you an idea of how the data has been preprocessed:

```
python data/load.py
```
